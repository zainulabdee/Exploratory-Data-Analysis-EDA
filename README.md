Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

AI/ML Internship – Project 2

🚢 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the well-known Titanic dataset. It's part of my AI & Machine Learning internship and aims to build foundational skills in data understanding, pattern detection, and visualization.
The objective is to use Python-based tools to dig into the data and uncover meaningful insights that can support machine learning workflows.

🎯 Project Goals

Gain familiarity with the Titanic dataset structure and attributes

Perform statistical summaries to describe the data

Visualize key variables and relationships to identify trends and outliers

Draw conclusions that can aid in model preparation and feature selection



---

🧰 Tech Stack

The following libraries and tools were used throughout the project:

Python – Core language for analysis

Pandas – Data manipulation and exploration

Matplotlib – Custom plotting and charting

Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

🔍 Step-by-Step EDA Workflow

1. Data Import & Inspection

Loaded the dataset and explored dimensions, column types, and missing values



2. Descriptive Statistics

Summarized data using mean, median, standard deviation, etc.



3. Univariate Analysis

Used histograms and boxplots to understand individual feature distributions



4. Categorical Feature Analysis

Applied count plots and pie charts to explore gender, class, and survival



5. Bivariate Analysis

Investigated correlations between variables using:

Heatmaps

Pairplots

Age vs Survival comparisons




6. Outlier & Skewness Detection

Identified abnormal patterns in features like Fare and Age



7. Documentation

All insights, charts, and code are well-documented in the notebook

📊 Visual Highlights

Some of the key visualizations include:

Survival distribution by gender and class

Age and Fare histogram comparisons

Heatmap of feature correlations

Age distribution with survival overlay



---

🔑 Major Insights

Female passengers and those in 1st class had a significantly higher survival rate

Younger passengers showed better chances of survival

Fare and Passenger Class had noticeable effects on survival outcome
